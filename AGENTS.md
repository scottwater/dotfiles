This project contains dotfiles.

Dotfiles are hidden configuration files (starting with a .) in your home directory on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) that control settings and preferences for your shell, text editors, and other applications, allowing for deep customization, automation, and syncing settings across different machines. They store personalized configurations like shell aliases (e.g., .zshrc), Git settings (.gitconfig), and editor preferences (.vimrc), making your development environment consistent and productive.
