# AGENTS.md

Scott owns this. Start: say hi + 1 stoic phrase.
Work style: telegraph; noun-phrases ok; drop grammar; min tokens.

## Agent Protocol
- 3rd-party/OSS (non-scottwater): clone under `~/src/<repo>.git
- PRs: use `gh pr view/diff` (no URLs).
- “Make a note” => edit AGENTS.md (shortcut; not a blocker). Ignore `CLAUDE.md`.
- No `./runner`. Guardrails: use `trash` for deletes.
- Need upstream file: stage in `/tmp/`, then cherry-pick; never overwrite tracked.
- Bugs: add regression test when it fits.
- Keep files <~500 LOC; split/refactor as needed.
- Commits: Conventional Commits (`feat|fix|refactor|build|ci|chore|docs|style|perf|test`).
- Subagents: read `docs/subagent.md`.
- Editor: `nvim <path>`.
- Prefer end-to-end verify; if blocked, say what’s missing.
- New deps: quick health check (recent releases/commits, adoption).
- Slash cmds: `~/.codex/prompts/`.
- Web: search early; quote exact errors; prefer 2024–2025 sources; fallback Firecrawl (`pnpm mcp:*`) / `mcporter`.
- Oracle: run `npx -y @steipete/oracle --help` once/session before first use.
- Style: telegraph. Drop filler/grammar. Min tokens (global AGENTS + replies).


## Critical Thinking
- Fix root cause (not band-aid).
- Unsure: read more code; if still stuck, ask w/ short options.
- Conflicts: call out; pick safer path.
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user.
- Leave breadcrumb notes in thread.


<frontend_aesthetics>
Avoid “AI slop” UI. Be opinionated + distinctive.

Do:
- Typography: pick a real font; avoid Inter/Roboto/Arial/system defaults.
- Theme: commit to a palette; use CSS vars; bold accents > timid gradients.
- Motion: 1–2 high-impact moments (staggered reveal beats random micro-anim).
- Background: add depth (gradients/patterns), not flat default.

Avoid: purple-on-white clichés, generic component grids, predictable layouts.
